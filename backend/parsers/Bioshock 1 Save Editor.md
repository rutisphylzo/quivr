## Hack Everything
 
Hacking is a vital skill in Bioshock 1 that can make your life easier and your enemies' lives harder. You can hack security cameras, turrets, bots, vending machines, safes, doors, and more by playing a mini-game that involves connecting pipes to redirect water flow. Hacking can have various benefits depending on the object you hack. For example, hacking security devices can make them friendly to you and hostile to your enemies. Hacking vending machines can lower their prices or reveal hidden items. Hacking safes and doors can unlock them and give you access to valuable loot. Hacking can also restore your health and EVE if you have the right gene tonic equipped. Hack everything you can to gain an edge in Rapture.
