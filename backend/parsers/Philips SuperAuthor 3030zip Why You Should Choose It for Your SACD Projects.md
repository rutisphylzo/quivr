SACD stands for Super Audio CD, a high-resolution audio format that was developed by Sony and Philips in 1999 as a successor to the standard CD format. SACD offers superior sound quality and surround sound effects by using a different encoding method called Direct Stream Digital (DSD), which uses a single bit to represent the amplitude of the sound wave at a very high sampling rate of 2.8224 MHz. This results in a more accurate and natural representation of the original sound source than the conventional Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) method used by CDs, which uses multiple bits to represent the amplitude of the sound wave at a lower sampling rate of 44.1 kHz.

SACD discs can store up to 4.7 GB of data, which is enough to hold about 74 minutes of stereo DSD audio or about 36 minutes of multichannel DSD audio. SACD discs can also be hybrid discs, which contain both a SACD layer and a CD layer, making them compatible with both SACD players and standard CD players. However, only SACD players can access the SACD layer and play the DSD audio, while standard CD players can only access the CD layer and play the PCM audio. SACD discs can also have various features and specifications, such as DST compression, copy protection, watermarking, gapless playback, text and graphics display, and more.
 
SACD is considered to be one of the best audio formats for audiophiles and music lovers who appreciate high-fidelity sound and surround sound effects. SACD offers a more immersive and realistic listening experience than CDs or other digital audio formats. However, SACD is also a niche format that has not gained widespread popularity or support from the music industry or the consumers. SACD discs are relatively expensive and hard to find, and SACD players are also rare and costly. Moreover, SACD discs cannot be played on computers or portable devices, unless they are converted to other formats such as PCM or MP3, which may compromise the sound quality. Therefore, SACD is mainly enjoyed by a small but loyal group of enthusiasts who value quality over convenience.
