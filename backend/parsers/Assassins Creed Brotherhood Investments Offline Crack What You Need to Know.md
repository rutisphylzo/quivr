Fortunately, there is a way to play Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood offline with investments, using a crack that bypasses the online check and allows you to invest in any shop or landmark without any restrictions. Here is how you can do it:
 
1. Download the crack from [this link](https://megagames.com/download/241268/0). It is a zip file that contains an updated version of the game executable and a patch.
2. Unpack the zip file and run `ac_brotherhood_1.03_update.exe`. This will install the patch that fixes some bugs and improves the game performance.
3. Copy the cracked game executable from the `SKIDROW` folder to the main install folder of the game and overwrite the original one.
4. Launch the game and enjoy playing offline with investments. You can invest in any shop or landmark you want, and you will receive income every 20 minutes.
5. Support the developers by buying the game if you like it.

Note: This crack is for version 1.03 of the game. If you have a different version, you may need to find a different crack that matches your version. Also, this crack may not work with some antivirus programs, so you may need to disable them temporarily or add an exception for the game executable.

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is not only a thrilling sequel to Assassin's Creed II, but also a game that introduces many new features and improvements to the series. Here are some of the features that make Brotherhood stand out:

- A new setting: Rome. Unlike the previous games, which featured multiple cities and regions, Brotherhood focuses on one large and detailed city that offers a variety of landmarks, districts, and secrets to explore. Rome is also the center of the Templar power in Italy, and Ezio must fight to liberate it from their influence.
- A new gameplay mechanic: recruiting and training Assassins. Ezio can recruit new members to his Brotherhood by saving citizens from Templar oppression or completing special missions. He can then train them by sending them on contracts across Europe or calling them for assistance during missions. The more experience they gain, the more skills and equipment they unlock.
- A new mode: multiplayer. Brotherhood is the first game in the main series to feature a multiplayer mode. The players are Templars in training at an Abstergo facility. They use the animi (plural for animus) seen at the beginning of Assassin's Creed II to access memories of old Templars and acquire their skills using the "bleeding effect". The multiplayer mode offers various modes and maps, each with different objectives and strategies.

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a game that offers a rich and immersive experience for fans of the series and newcomers alike. It is a game that combines historical accuracy, stealth action, and social interaction in a unique and captivating way.
