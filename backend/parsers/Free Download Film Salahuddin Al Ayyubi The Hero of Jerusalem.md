In 1169, Salahuddin became the vizier of Egypt, which was under the control of the Zengids. He soon established himself as the de facto ruler of Egypt, where he reformed the administration, economy and military. He also built many schools, hospitals and mosques in Cairo and other cities. He defended Egypt from the attacks of the Crusaders and the Fatimids, who claimed to be the rightful rulers of Egypt.
 
In 1174, Nur ad-Din died and Salahuddin declared himself the sultan of Egypt and Syria. He then embarked on a campaign to unify the Muslim lands under his authority. He fought against the Crusaders, who had established several states in Palestine and Lebanon, as well as against the rival Muslim factions that opposed his rule. He also expanded his domains to include parts of Yemen, Libya and Sudan.
 
Salahuddin's greatest achievement was his victory over the Crusaders at the Battle of Hattin in 1187. He defeated a large army led by King Guy of Jerusalem and captured most of their leaders, including Guy himself and Reynald of Chatillon, who had provoked Salahuddin by raiding Muslim caravans and pilgrims. Salahuddin spared Guy's life but executed Reynald for his crimes. He then proceeded to recapture Jerusalem from the Crusaders, who had occupied it since 1099.
 
Salahuddin's conquest of Jerusalem was met with jubilation by the Muslims and dismay by the Christians. Pope Urban III reportedly died of shock when he heard the news. The Crusaders launched a third crusade to regain Jerusalem, led by King Richard I of England, King Philip II of France and Emperor Frederick I of Germany. Salahuddin resisted their attacks and negotiated a truce with Richard in 1192. The truce allowed the Crusaders to keep a coastal strip of land in Palestine, but granted Muslims access to Jerusalem for worship.
 
Salahuddin died in 1193 in Damascus. He was mourned by both Muslims and Christians, who respected him for his bravery, generosity and chivalry. He left behind a legacy of Islamic unity, justice and tolerance that inspired many generations after him.
