# An Introduction To The Calculus Of Variations Fox Pdf 14: A Classic Book on Mathematical Physics
 
The calculus of variations is a branch of mathematics that deals with finding the optimal values of functions that depend on other functions. It has applications in many fields of science and engineering, such as mechanics, optics, geometry, and control theory. One of the most famous books on this topic is *An Introduction to the Calculus of Variations* by Charles Fox, first published in 1950 and revised in 1987.

In this book, Fox provides a comprehensive and rigorous introduction to the theory and methods of the calculus of variations. He covers the basic concepts and results, such as the first and second variations of an integral, the Euler-Lagrange equation, the Hamiltonian formalism, the principle of least action, and the Rayleigh-Ritz method. He also discusses some advanced topics, such as integrals with variable end points, strong variations, and the Weierstrassian theory. He illustrates the theory with many examples and applications from physics and engineering, such as the catenary problem, the brachistochrone problem, Hamilton's principle in special relativity, and quantum mechanics.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise style, with a logical organization and a careful exposition of proofs. It assumes some background knowledge in analysis, differential equations, and classical mechanics. It is suitable for graduate students and researchers who want to learn more about this fascinating and important subject.

The calculus of variations has a long and rich history, dating back to the ancient Greeks. The first systematic study of the subject was done by Johann Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. They solved many famous problems, such as the brachistochrone problem, which asks for the curve of fastest descent between two points under gravity. They also developed the Euler-Lagrange equation, which is the fundamental equation of the calculus of variations.
 
In the 19th century, the calculus of variations was further developed by Joseph-Louis Lagrange, William Rowan Hamilton, Carl Gustav Jacobi, and others. They introduced new concepts and methods, such as the Hamiltonian function, the Legendre transformation, the variational principle, and the canonical equations. They applied the calculus of variations to various problems in mechanics, optics, and astronomy.
 
In the 20th century, the calculus of variations was extended to more general settings and more diverse applications. Some of the notable contributors were David Hilbert, Emmy Noether, Lev Pontryagin, Richard Courant, and John von Neumann. They generalized the calculus of variations to include functionals with higher derivatives, partial differential equations, integral equations, and functional analysis. They also applied the calculus of variations to problems in geometry, topology, quantum mechanics, control theory, and optimization.
