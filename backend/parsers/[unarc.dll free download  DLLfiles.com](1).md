2. Locate the current unarc.dll file on your computer and rename it as unarc.bak.dll. You can find it in the `%systemroot%\System32` folder on 32 bit systems or in the `%systemroot%\SysWOW64` folder on 64 bit systems.

## Solution 2: Register Unarc.dll with Regsvr32

4. Close the command prompt and try to run the program that needs unarc.dll again.

## Solution 3: Check Your Disk Space and Archive Integrity
 
Sometimes unarc.dll errors can occur because there is not enough disk space to unpack the compressed archive or because the archive is corrupted or unreadable. To fix this, you can try these steps:

1. Make sure you have enough free space on your hard drive to extract the archive. You can check your disk space by right-clicking your drive in File Explorer and selecting Properties.
2. If you downloaded the archive from the internet, make sure it is not corrupted or incomplete. You can use a tool like [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html) or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to test the archive integrity and repair it if possible.
3. If you copied the archive from another source, such as a CD or a USB drive, make sure it is not damaged or scratched. You can try to copy it again or use another source if available.
4. If you have permission issues with extracting the archive, try to run the program as an administrator or change the destination folder to one that you have full access to.
