Hunt Down The Freeman is a game that has received mixed reviews from players and critics. Some praised its ambitious scope, its original story, its voice acting and its soundtrack. Others criticized its numerous bugs, its poor level design, its inconsistent graphics, its long loading times and its allegations of plagiarism. The game currently has a 4/10 rating on Steam[^1^], based on over 2,600 reviews.
 
One of the most controversial aspects of Hunt Down The Freeman is its use of assets from other games and sources without proper credit or permission. The game has been accused of stealing models, textures, sounds and maps from games such as Half-Life 2, Call of Duty, Crysis and Fallout. It has also been alleged that the game used fan-made mods and artworks without the consent of their creators. Some of these assets have been removed or replaced in later updates, but some still remain in the game.
 
Another issue that Hunt Down The Freeman faced was its development process and communication with the community. The game was originally announced in 2017 as a free mod for Half-Life 2, but later changed to a standalone commercial game. The game was delayed several times and released with little marketing or hype. The developers also faced backlash for their lack of transparency, their unprofessional behavior and their hostile attitude towards critics and fans. Some of the developers have since left the project or apologized for their mistakes.
