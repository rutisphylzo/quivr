Heat Conduction is a textbook that provides students with the tools to model, analyze and solve a wide range of engineering applications involving conduction heat transfer. The book covers topics such as one-dimensional and two-dimensional steady state conduction, transient conduction, conduction in porous media, conduction with phase change, non-linear conduction problems, approximate solutions, perturbation solutions, heat transfer in living tissue and microscale conduction. The book also includes many examples, exercises and homework helpers. A solution manual can be provided to professors upon request.

In this section, we will briefly introduce some of the main concepts and methods covered in the book. We will also provide some examples of how they can be applied to real-world problems.
 
## Basic Concepts
 
The book starts with an overview of the basic concepts of heat conduction, such as temperature, heat flux, heat rate, thermal conductivity, thermal resistance and thermal diffusivity. It also introduces the general heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of temperature in a medium as a function of time and space. The book explains how to apply the heat equation to different geometries and boundary conditions, such as Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical coordinates, and specified temperature, specified flux and convection boundaries.
 
## One-Dimensional Steady State Conduction
 
The book then focuses on one-dimensional steady state conduction problems, which are problems where the temperature does not vary with time and only depends on one spatial coordinate. The book shows how to solve these problems analytically using separation of variables, superposition and Fourier series. It also discusses how to use graphical and numerical methods, such as charts, tables and finite difference schemes. Some examples of one-dimensional steady state conduction problems are heat transfer through a wall, a pipe or a fin.
 
## Two-Dimensional Steady State Conduction
 
The book moves on to two-dimensional steady state conduction problems, which are problems where the temperature does not vary with time and depends on two spatial coordinates. The book explains how to solve these problems analytically using separation of variables, superposition and Fourier series. It also introduces some special techniques for solving problems with symmetry or periodicity, such as polar coordinates, conformal mapping and Bessel functions. Some examples of two-dimensional steady state conduction problems are heat transfer in a rectangular plate, a circular disk or an annulus.
