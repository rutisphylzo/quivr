I want to express my gratitude to Koko for his/her assistance and guidance, everything worked smoothly and without any errors. If anyone is having trouble downloading the Fences setup file from the official website, I encountered the same problem today, so I searched for an alternative source and found this one:
 -stardock-fences.html
I hope this helps you all.
