Updating your navigation system with this DVD is easy and takes a few hours. You will need three DVDs: DVD 1a, DVD 1b, and DVD 2. You can download them from various online sources[^1^] [^2^] or buy them from authorized dealers. You will also need a DVD burner and some blank DVDs. We recommend using DVD+R (4.7GB) discs and burning them at a slow speed (4x or 8x) with a reliable software like ImgBurn or Alcohol 120%. Use high-quality DVD media, such as Verbatim.
 
Once you have the DVDs ready, follow these steps to update your navigation system:
 
1. Insert DVD 1a into the COMAND APS slot in your car. The update process will start automatically and reach about 3%.
2. A message will appear on the screen saying that the update cannot continue and DVD 1 is required. Eject DVD 1a and insert DVD 1b.
3. The update process will resume from about 3% and reach about 58%. Eject DVD 1b and insert DVD 1a again.
4. The update process will resume from about 58% and reach about 92%. Eject DVD 1a and insert DVD 2.
5. The update process will resume from about 92% and finish at 100%. Eject DVD 2 and enjoy your updated navigation system.

Note: The update process may take a couple of hours, depending on your car model and configuration. Make sure your car battery is fully charged or connect it to a charger. You can also drive your car during the update, but do not turn off the ignition or eject the DVDs until the process is complete. If the screen goes black during the update, press the knob to wake it up.
