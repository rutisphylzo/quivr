## How Axara 2D to 3D Video Converter Works
 
Axara 2D to 3D Video Converter uses a special algorithm that analyzes the depth and motion of the objects in the 2D video and creates a corresponding depth map. The depth map is then used to generate two slightly different views of the same scene, one for the left eye and one for the right eye. These two views are then combined into a single 3D video file that can be viewed with 3D glasses or a 3D display.
