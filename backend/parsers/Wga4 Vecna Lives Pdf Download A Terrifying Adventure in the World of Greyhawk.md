- The difficulty and lethality of the adventure. The module warns that it is meant to kill characters, and it does not hold back on throwing deadly challenges at the players. Some reviewers have found this to be unfair and frustrating, while others have enjoyed the challenge and the sense of danger.
- The use of pregenerated characters. The module requires players to use pregenerated characters that are provided in the book, rather than their own. Some reviewers have disliked this restriction, arguing that it reduces player agency and attachment to the characters. Others have defended this choice, claiming that it enhances the story and the mood of the adventure.
- The plot and the portrayal of Vecna. The module features a complex and convoluted plot that involves Vecna's return from Ravenloft, his ascension to godhood, his conflict with Iuz and Kas, and his attempt to destroy the world. Some reviewers have praised this plot as epic and intriguing, while others have criticized it as nonsensical and contrived. Similarly, some reviewers have liked Vecna's depiction as a powerful and mysterious villain, while others have disliked his characterization as a petty and foolish tyrant.
